I also attended Cabrillo when I was in high school, I was an art student and I loved like making off my own clothes. I loved painting murals. I would rearrange my mom's house which you know, everyday she came home she was like, Where is the couch?\n",
            " So I graduated but really didn't know what to do. I shared with my parents, I thought maybe I wanted to be an artist. And as you know, they're like starving artists. Not going to happen. So um, they couldn't relate. My dad had a PhD as a scientist, my mom's a teacher. So you know, they encouraged me to just get my general education.\n",
            " While I was going to college, at Cabrillo Cabrillo. I saw a job as a model. So I started to model in the industry. And then got to know like the owner of the company that was working for, now, at that time, it was actually a fashion auction. Now we don't have those anymore. Yeah, it's like a runway show. But this is selling we're selling in that case designer samples. This is before like TJ Maxx was before Ross or Marshalls. So people would come to the show to get like amazing fashion at a discounted price. And we would auction off the clothes. So I started to help her buy merchandise because I was younger than she was for the for the shows. And from there I just got more interested and helped her to open a couple of boutiques and then also became an auctionier.\n",

We You're auctioning, we may have, you know, 80 items, in an hour, you know. So you have to cut it off, you have like 40 seconds per item. But from there, I saw I was auctioning, but just loving fashion working with DJs, working with models, styling the clothes, and I was still going to college. I went to San Jose State. Well, it was really kind of around my voice because I was one of those people that didn't mind getting up in front of an audience. Yes, you know, so I had pretty good odds because of that not everybody likes to talk in front of an audience. So ultimately, I wanted to go for broadcast journalism. But because I took so many years at Cabrillo, and so much time to figure out what I was doing. By the time I was getting my degree, I was married. And I had a child. Yeah, I went to college for like eight years.\n",

            "Because I think it was because nobody acknowledged what I wanted to do you know how they took a taken a studied look at those things that I did naturally. Well, if they saw, you know, the kinds of activities that I liked, they would have said like, why don't you look at the field of design? Well, no, because it was just something I did. I didn't think that it could I just didn't even know you could do you know without for living?\n",
            " The design industry. The fashion industry is huge in Southern California. Yeah, even San Francisco, you have Levi Strauss and GAAP, a lot of big companies. But you know, in Santa Cruz, we do actually have like Santa Cruz skateboards, and Neil's was founded here. So, you know, if you, if you kind of look around, then you see it. But by the time I graduated, and, you know, I was looking at becoming a broadcast journalist, it, it hit me, it's like, oh, you have to be up at 2am in the morning. I was like, not a morning person, even at like 6am. And I had a child. So I was like, that's just not gonna work, you know. So my next step was to go into public relations.\n",
            " So one thing that I did find out about myself as well was my first public relations job was with a high tech company way, way back in the day, when Silicon Valley was just being founded. I was sitting in my office looking out the window, and I saw this guy raking. And I was watching him rake, and I'm like, Oh, my God, that just looks wonderful. Like, I want to be out there raking leaves with him, like, you know, kind of cleaning it up. And you know, I'm kind of looking at them planting the plants. And I'm at that time, I just had this epiphany, like this realization, it's like, oh, my gosh, you are in the wrong line of business girlfriend, like, this is not what you want to do, you do not want to sit at a desk, you don't want to work in a computer, you want to be out there, and you want to like make things more beautiful. \n",
            "So I didn't exactly have a plan for that. But I did know that I could still do fashion. And that was more active and it wasn't desk oriented. So I started my own business at that time, and did also sell designer samples. So along the way, and I was also a professional auctioneer by then. And so I did a lot of charity auctions.\n",

            "Well, they actually have schools too, become auctioneers I did not go to school, you can study it's kind of like the real estate license. So okay, so back then, you did need a license to auctioneer and to get the license. You had to know like, you know, the different parts of the cow. You have to know the different kinds of horses because they really, Yeah, so I learned that I, don't quiz me now. And then just really practiced, you know, with different increments and being able to, you know, to fill and really the thing that I loved is working with the audience, you know, making eye contact, having that nonverbal communication, kind of the psychology of the sale. \n",
            "So, so doing, like, large events for different charities was, was fun. But, you know, after a while, I was definitely getting a little tired. And that's when a friend of mine, who was the editor of the good times, said, Hey, I see this job. And it says that the Fashion Institute needs a public speaker. I'm like, well, that works. You know, I've done fashion and I'm a public speaker. And this would be the perfect marriage. So that's what I did. I applied. They liked me. They're like my background. I had a degree. And, you know, even though it wasn't the same degree, like it was public relations, so that worked well, yeah. For what I was going into\n",

            "They did. Actually, they asked me to stand up and tell them a little bit about myself. Yeah. So I think I might have shared like, you know, I think they asked me like, what was my first job? You know, so of course, I had to share with them I was an elf. And I was an elf at a place called Santas village. it was in Scotts Valley. Oh, wow. And they actually had another place called lost world. And lost World was across the freeway, kind of near where Scotts Valley High School is in that area. They used to have this huge dinosaur. It was like 50 feet tall. Well, as you drove there. It's dead. No, I don't. It's replaced by something. It's yeah, it's been moved. It was awesome. And then Santos village, Mr. And Mrs. Claus live there. I ran the merry go round. But eventually, I was promoted. And I drove the train. So think boardwalk, but now, but Santa, you know, in the forest, and it was in a redwood Grove, it's now exactly where all of the new buildings there's new, like condos have just been put up there near Seagate. So anyhow, so I was just, you know, the envy of the other elves because I got to drive the train. So, but it was, it was fine. It was my first step into, you know, show business.\n",

So we have historical one's like on the history and fashion of France. Like Louie the 14th was the first to wear the high heel and popularized Leonardo da Vinci was one man that worked on the invention of the high heel. There's some pretty cool history. We do you know, the history of modern American dress and how World War II really allowed women to wear pants yet, even here in Santa Cruz, Going to high school in the 60s, my older cousins were the 60s, they couldn't wear pants to school. So there was like this huge revolution in 1970, when all the girls started wearing pants, so it allows me the job itself allows me to kind of venture out, we do professional development, workshops, social media management workshops, visual communications workshops. So the job continues, you know, continuously requires me to learn.

So I think, you know, when I think of the students that I've met, that have just had that insight, that was definitely probably the most rewarding is just, you know, share, you know, sharing with them and their families that this is a huge, multi multibillion dollar global industry, and that there is so much opportunity.

So it's not only teenagers that may not know about this industry, but educators, administrators, the general public, and I think it's it, unfortunately, the art and design of the things that we own and value haven't really been given the value, the people that create them here haven't been given the value that perhaps they need to be recognized for. If you go to Europe, a fashion designer is the equivalent to like a lawyer or a doctor, they're very highly esteemed, they're artists. And here, you know, the United States we, I think just take them for granted, you know, like it just happens or something. So So that's challenging.\n",

Originally, as I mentioned, I saw that maybe by innovating the news, like instead of like turning on the the nightly news as a broadcaster to gloom and doom, you know, why don't we talk about, like, all the amazing things that are happening, like, because I think it is a social psychology, you know, the more negative things that we think about the more maybe they manifest.

But if you surround yourself in too much black, it can, you know, start to pull you into the darkness a little bit more.

But today, I would probably do. Maybe interior design or visual communications. Visual Communications is really fluid, it's creating environments, it could include sound, lighting, it's really developing experiences for people. So you can bring in multimedia. So it's got a lot of freedom in the field. I'm also a yoga person. So I am really fascinated with just that connection between like, you know, our mind, our body and our and the environment, and how that all works together.
